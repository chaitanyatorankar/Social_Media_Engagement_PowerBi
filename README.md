Project Description: Mutual Fund Performance Analysis in Power BI

This project analyzes mutual fund performance data from different Asset Management Companies (AMCs). The dataset contains 1,088 records with details about mutual funds, including their category, risk type, ratings, and returns across multiple time horizons (1-year, 3-year, and 5-year).

ðŸ”‘ Key Dataset Features:

AMC_name â€“ Name of the Asset Management Company (AMC).

Mutual Fund Name â€“ Full name of the mutual fund scheme.

Category â€“ Fund classification (e.g., Equity, Debt, Hybrid).

Risk Type â€“ Risk categorization (e.g., Low, Moderate, High, Very High).

Fund Rating â€“ Investor rating (scale of 1â€“5).

Return_1yr, Return_3yr, Return_5yr â€“ Annualized percentage returns over different periods.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives:

Compare performance of mutual funds across AMCs.

Evaluate fund ratings and risk types.

Identify top-performing funds in short-term and long-term horizons.

Provide insights into risk-return trade-offs for investors.

Enable interactive filtering and visualization of mutual funds based on categories, AMCs, ratings, and time horizons.

ðŸ“Œ Expected Power BI Visualizations:

KPI Cards â€“ Average return (1yr, 3yr, 5yr), highest-rated funds.

Bar/Column Charts â€“ Top AMCs by average fund returns.

Heatmaps â€“ Risk type vs. average returns.

Scatterplots â€“ Fund rating vs. returns.

Filters/Slicers â€“ By AMC, category, risk level, or time horizon.
